## Adding License Information

In the static constructor of your main project class, add the following line:

```
ComponentInfo.SetLicense("FREE-LIMITED-KEY")
```

Of course, if you purchased Professional version, replace "FREE-LIMITED-KEY" with your Professional serial key.
You should call `SetLicense()` method before using any other class from GemBox.Pdf library. `SetLicense()` method can be called multiple times, but always with the same license key (if you try multiple keys, exception will be thrown).
